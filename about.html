		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>My name is Victor Veytsman. I am a seventeen-year-old living in Brooklyn, New York, and going to Stuyvesant High School. I like programming with Go and JavaScript, and using those to create full stack web applications. I use the Arch distro of Linux with the Vim editor. Aside from using computers, I like skiing and playing the flute.</p>
		<p>I am currently in the Stuyvesant Student Union IT department. I also do Model UN at school, having gone to several local and collegiate conferences and having played a part in several committees at my school's conferences. In the past, I have taught programming in a club at my middle school and volunteered at a couple of my middle schools' events.</p>
